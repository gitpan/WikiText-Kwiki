Have you signed up?  You should, now.

* *The private nature of DBI apparently-public hashes*

** by [Jeff Zucker http://www.vpservices.com/jeff/]

** Why does DBI allow you to do things like $dbh->{!RaiseError}=1?  Shouldn't it do that with an encapsulated, private method?  Nope!  Find out why.

** DBI is made of people!  PEOPLE!! <-- I didn't put this here, but I agree:-)


* *Simple privacy* or *My code has a shotgun*  http://www.pobox.com/~schwern/img/boomstick.jpg

** by MichaelSchwern  

** Perl's philosophy on OO privacy is "[=it would prefer that you stayed out of its living room because you weren't invited, not because it has a shotgun.]"  While this mostly works in practice, sometimes you need a shotgun.  Unfortunately, many of the existing OO privacy modules in Perl (Class::Contract, Tie::!SecureHash) are more like howitzers.

** Two simple, efficient solutions to allow truly private methods and truly private object attributes.  Along the way some annoyances of Perl inheritance will disappear.

** 15 minutes.


* *This Parrot Plays Games*

** [chromatic]

** Parrot, the VM for Perl 6, is an object oriented assembly language with an exceedingly rich vocabulary of primitives -- if "primitives" is the right word.  What happens when you link it to a nice multimedia library such as SDL?  How much code does it take to do something interesting?

** This is a work in progress, but it's surprisingly advanced, even now.

** Oops, I probably won't be in town for this.  If I am, I'll talk, but don't count on it now.  Many apologies.

* *Look Ma, Software*

** Austin Schutz

** How do you get from all that junk in your head to coherent source code? This talk involves a 4 (or so) stage process to go from the idea stage to an object oriented software map.

** This is also a WIP, and comments are welcome. This will require a white board, if anyone has one it would be swell if they could bring it and let me (tex@off.org) know.

** 15 minutes.


* *Pointer.pm*

** BrianIngerson

* *My first Perl-Tk program*
