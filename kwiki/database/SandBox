A search didn't turn up the real sandbox.

Tom Keller is asking about ordered lists on the email list.

I thought
 
#. item 1
#. item 2

or 

 1. item 1
 1. item 2

would work 

but 0 (zero) is the key

0 item 1
0 item 2
00 nested item 1
00 nested item 2

How 'bout nesting ordered and unordered
0 one
0 two
00 sub two
** sub sub two
0 three - this doesn't work with my kwiki set up
** so there must be a plugin here that I don't have installed and/or added

THANKS
