=== wxPerl:  What I had to Learn the Hard Way ===

EricWilhelm talked about how to get started with the Perl bindings to the wxwidgets GUI toolkit.  Eric has spent the last several months designing and building a large (7.5kLOC and growing in 62 modules) system complete with a comprehensive test suite, pluggable, reskinnable architecture, network-transparent connectivity, blah, blah, blah (ok, the blah part is done, but I'm still working on some of the other bits.)

* overview
* how cross platform is it?
* finding documentation
* installation on Windows, Mac, and Linux
* code generation with wxglade (or not)
* creating a sane object-oriented architecture while using an event-driven toolkit
* testing
