My original career was in mental health before veering through an MBA program, massage school and learning a bunch about Macs, Windows and finally Linux.

I live in Portland with my wife and cat. I've been worked on the Homestreet/Collaborative Technologies/SQL Clinic project for over a year...

I am also the founder and editor of the [News4Neighbors http://www.news4neighbors.net] website. N4N is a grassroots community driven news site for the people of Portland Oregon. It's built on the open source Slashcode software that runs [Slashdot http://slashdot.org].
