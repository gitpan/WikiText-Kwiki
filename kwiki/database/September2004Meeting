Lennon's slides on !WEBrick: Ruby's Standard Web Server are [here http://rcoder.net/talks/pm_sep04/webrick/index.html], and his slides on Extending and Embedding Ruby in C are [here http://rcoder.net/talks/pm_sep04/c_api/index.html]

What's up in Ruby-land?

Ruby is an object oriented, agile language with some noticable Perl-ish 
accents.  For Perlmongers interested in exploring new languages, Ruby is a 
good choice for exploration.  It's similar enough that you'll be able to 
find your way around without a translator (most of the time), yet 
different enough to make the exploration interesting and educational 
(kind of like visiting England:).  After a quick intro to Ruby, your tour 
guides, Lennon Day-Reynolds and Phil Tomson, will lead you through some of 
the more interesting features of Ruby, including:
* Code blocks for creating domain specific languages (or, "Here's something the Python would choke on" :)
* C extensions and embedding Ruby
* Ruby and the web - the WEBrick http servlet
... and time permitting:
* We'll demo the installation of Instiki (a popular Ruby Wiki) 
covering ALL of the technical details ;-)

Afterwards, as always, beer at the [Lucky Lab http://www.luckylab.com/lab_hawth.html]!

/Note the start time has been moved back to 7pm, as to accomodate our speakers./
