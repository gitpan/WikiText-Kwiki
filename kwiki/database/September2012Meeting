= CPAN Modules Not With h2xs + Dist::Zilla and Pod::Weaver

speakers: Ian Dees + Joshua Keroes

Ian will cover what it's like for n00bs learning how to create a new Perl module, including:

* Where rookies look for "Getting Started" information
* Which tools we can readily find for the job
* What kinds of questions we have about namespaces
* What Ian would like to do to help:
** Listen to your answers
** Format them into some kind of guide (or supplement an existing one)
** Hand it to a Perl expert to post in the right place
** Commit to checking in a couple of times a year to keep the information current

You will be vastly enlightened, or horrified.

Joshua will continue down the Dist::Zilla path of Automated Enlightenment and speak on Pod::Weaver.

In July, Duke Leto gave Portland an introduction to Dist::Zilla, demonstrating how it can help write, package, test, and release your modules; automating the boring stuff like figuring out prerequisites, automatically inserting and updating $VERSION's, getting rid of all those meta files and generating them automatically; all good ways to focus on the important stuff: the code.

This month, Joshua will show how Pod::Weaver can help automate the boring parts of writing documentation so you can avoid getting bogged down by boilerplate and focus on the important stuff there: the docs.
