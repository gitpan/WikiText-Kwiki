Kees Cook

A hackfest/code-review of Kees Cook's "[http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Device%3A%3ASerialPort Device::SerialPort] - Serial Port functions" module and tests.

At the end of the meeting, Kees was awarded the Steel Splat of Stoutheartedness -- a never-before awarded pdx.pm medal -- for "the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme perl."  We also e-mailed him the patch that resulted from the ~12 pdx.pm'ers hacking on his code for 2 hours.
