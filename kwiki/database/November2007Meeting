=== Rapping about Declarative Problem Solving ===

A round-table discussion of various techniques (involving DSLs, YAML, SQL, Prolog, etc) for solving problems by declaring rules or data.  Join-in with your questions, comments, and/or case-studies about issues like:

* eliminating large procedural constructs (e.g. if, elsif, elsif, else)
* separation of concerns
* delegating rules, tests, and data to non-programmers
* sandboxed/restricted "code"
* portable procedures

There is a podcast [http://pdxpm.podasp.com/archive.html?pname=meetings.xml here].
