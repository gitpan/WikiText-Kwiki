== Hotels for OSCON 2005 ==

Advice from the locals on where to stay for [OSCON 2005 http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/].

The Convention Center has its own MAX light rail stop and is inside "fareless square". This means many hotels in downtown Portland are a free ride away from OSCON. Visit http://www.trimet.org. With the Trip Planner you can look up how long it will take to get to the Convention Center from any hotel, get walking directions to the nearest MAX stop from the hotel, and find out whether the stop is in fareless square.

"My wife's family stayed at the Mallory Hotel a year ago. It was very pleasant and right on the Max train route, so it's easy to get to the Convention Center." --Tom Keller

Rumor has it the official hotel is:
Doubletree Hotel Portland

No details yet, but I wonder if they mean:
* Doubletree Hotel & Executive Meeting Center Portland-Lloyd Center; 1000 NE Multnomah; Portland,  Oregon 97232; +1-503-281-6111
* Trimet estimates 8 minutes (5 minutes walking). Lloyd Center/NE 11th is in fareless square.

=== On the cheap ===

A few inexpensive places to stay:

The [Hawthorne Hostel http://www.portlandhostel.org/]
* Clean, friendly, about $20/night for dorm, $45/night for a private room.
* Short, direct bus ride to the conference.
* Free wireless.
* Powell's annex nearby.

The [NW Hostel http://www.2oregonhostels.com/nw_home.htm]

* Similar attributes to the above.
* Bigger Powell's. :)
* Trimet estimates 30 minutes (14 minutes walking). The PGE Park station isn't in fareless square, but Zone 1 tickets are $1.35 for one (I don't think you can buy singles anymore -- BrettWarden) or [$12.50 for 10 http://www.trimet.org/store/onezone.htm] (enough for the week).
