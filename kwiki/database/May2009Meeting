speakers:  Schwern, [gabrielle], DukeLeto, [hdp], [http://pdx.pm.org/kwiki/index.cgi?PortlandPerlMongerMembers maybe even You]

What tools and techniques do you use to keep your project shiny and well-oiled?  Bring a sample for show-and-tell, or just a few things to say about it.

For those of you who are speaking, write something here.

If you have questions, write those here too.

* [gabrielle] - I will share my experiences as a testing newbie, including "barriers to getting started".  I will show off my newly-mocked object for further mocking. :)
* [hdp] - managing & installing dependencies, or Dist::Zilla
* DukeLeto - fun with [http://search.cpan.org/dist/Smolder/ Smolder] ([http://github.com/mpeters/smolder/tree/master github])
* MichaelSchwern - recap of the 2009 Perl QA Hackathon o' Birmingham

The panel will be overseen by someone who makes sure that we get to the LuckyLab in time.
