*Perlbal, by Brad Fitzpatrick*

Brad Fitzpatrick is the founder and fearless leader of !LiveJournal.com, an Open Source project and company focused on blogging and social networking with over 3,000,000 accounts, over half of which are in active use. His specialties have come to include Perl, frightening !MySQL replication topologies, load balancing, distributed caching, scalability, and
high-availability. He dislikes buying unnecessary hardware and commercial software. As such, he finds or creates ways to get more out of hardware, the open source way.

Perlbal

Perlbal's a load-balancing reverse HTTP proxy, as well as a webserver, as well as hybrid combo (useful for serving big files with complex
auth/mapping which Perl/PHP is better at). It also has web-based stats. It uses epoll and sendfile to do things incredibly fast which Perl normally sucks at. Everything works in a single thread using an event-based model (hence epoll) and all truly synchronous operations (like the one-time stat and open syscalls before a sendfile) are done in a cloned helper thread which communicates the results back async over a pipe (Linux::AIO module).

Basically it all shows how you can do really fancy low-level stuff in Perl and still be fast.
