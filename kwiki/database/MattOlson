I have attended few meetings, however, I do know a number of the people here from the local tech community.  

My on-line presence is via [http://www.oceanconsulting.com/ Ocean Consulting].  I have worked as a local I.T. consultant for a number of years and currently work for a local ASP that services technology standards consortia.  

Most of my Perl experience comes from writing data warehouse/DBI applications.  

I can be reached via pm <at> oceanconsulting <dot> com.
