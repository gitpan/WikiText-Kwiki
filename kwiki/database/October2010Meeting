== Practical Lists / Utilities pulled from Fennec

speaker: Chad Granum

Chad will give 2 shorter talks in a row. The first talk will deal with lists, what they are, how to use them. The second talk is a short presentation on several useful tools/utilities that started as part of the Fennec project but have been pulled out for general use.

=== Practical Lists

Chad will define what a list is and how it differs from an array. He will cover tools such as grep and map, as well as some List::Util functions. He will explain how you may start using lists in more places when you understand how they work.

=== Utilities pulled from Fennec

Fennec was a large undertaking, it also required implementing a few new ideas. Many of the new ideas are useful outside of the Fennec project. Chad will cover
the following until he runs out of time:

* Exporter::Declare
* Method::Workflow
* Child
* Exodist::Util
* Devel::CallerStack
