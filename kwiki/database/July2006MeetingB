* Behind the Scenes at Perl.org

Robert Spier, the White Camel Award-winning co-administrator of perl.org talked about what perl.org does, is, etc.

The long and short of it is that there's lots you can do to help, but it's going to be a while before he gives you root.

Robert is looking for some help updating these sites to their [http://combust.develooper.com/ combust] framework and/or making various other improvements:

* http://www.nntp.perl.org/
* http://learn.perl.org/

And any incremental content improvements for any of the perl.org sites.
