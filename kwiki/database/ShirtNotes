A snippet of wisdom from FearlessJosh:

Get possible designs from people in the group, put them on the wiki, we vote, and then get the shirts printed.  Trying to find a local place to print the shirts is good, but cheap is also important.  Also get buttons made, possbily from [Microcosm http://www.microcosmpublishing.com/manufacturing/buttons/]  As far as shirt sizes, here are some rough numbers:

** ~2 S
** ~5 M
** ~10-15 L
** ~15 XL
** ~7 XXL (might cost more)
** XXXL by request (might cost more)
