== February Meeting ==
==== February 9th, 2005 6:30pm at Free Geek, 1741 SE 10th Ave ====

Tom Heady has offered to talk about the [phalanx project http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/] and how to
contribute.  He's also going to talk about Devel::Cover and how to use it
to ensure the coverage of your tests.  See Randall Hansen's [email http://mail.pm.org/pipermail/pdx-pm-list/2005-January/002389.html] for a review of Devel::Cover.

Postmortem: It was decided that we will take [App::Info http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-Info/] module through the [phalanx project http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/].  
Join us at AppInfoPhalanx as we improve the [Kwalitee http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/kwalitee.html] of this module.

----
Afterwards, as always, beer at the [Lucky Lab http://www.luckylab.com/html/directions.html#brewpub]!
