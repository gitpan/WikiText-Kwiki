== April2007Meeting -- Live Parrot Sketch ==

[chromatic] talked about parrot.

May include a bit of a "when we last saw our heroes..." catch-up/history lesson, possibly with a few clips of the best car chases, reaction-takes that go with the "oh! _You're_ the double-agent" reveals, and etc.  Of course, that can't go on too long, or those who have been playing the home game will get bored.

Interested in the design/internals/PIR?  How Parrot is supporting diverse features of multiple languages?  Interoperability?  Just here for the beer?

Links coming soon...
