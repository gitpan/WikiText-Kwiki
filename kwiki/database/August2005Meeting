Adam Kennedy, PPI - Parsing, Analyzing and Manipulating Perl (without perl)

PPI is finally here. And it brings with it a paradigm shift in the way
in which we work with Perl source code. Voted the "talk that made my
head hurt the most", come find out why "Only perl can parse Perl" is
dead, why "perl can't parse Perl", and discover vast sweeping fjords of
cool new Perl-related modules.

Afterwards, as always, beer at the LuckyLab!
