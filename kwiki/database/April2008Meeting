=== im in ur database - PL/LOLCODE ===

Speaker:  Selena Deckelmann

Database procedural languages are a powerful tool. You can speed up
your application, save network bandwidth, and impress your developer
friends.  And you can write the code in a language even your cat will
understand.

Come learn more about how to be a database hero with [http://pllolcode.projects.postgresql.org/ PL/LOLCODE].

This introduction to a procedural language will be offered by Selena
Deckelmann. Her most recent accomplishment was running !PostgreSQL
Conference East, over in Washington DC. Also, Linux Magazine published
her first article about !PostgreSQL 8.3 in March 2008. She's also on
the board of [http://www.legionoftech.org Legion of Tech], and runs
PDXPUG, the local !PostgreSQL users group. Other stuff about her can be
found at http://www.chesnok.com/daily/
