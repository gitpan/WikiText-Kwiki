Intro to OO Perl

Randal Schwartz presents "perldoc perlboot" live, with references to animals, procreation, death, and eating. Learn about Perl's object system from the ground up. Familiarity with references, Perl code, and death is helpful. Sense of humor mandatory.

Note the date! Randal's going to be out of town on the second Wednesday, which is our normal meeting day, so we're having it a week early. 

Afterwards, as always, beer at the [Lucky Lab http://www.luckylab.com/lab_hawth.html]!
