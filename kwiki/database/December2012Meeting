= Prime Number Generation in Perl

speaker: Dana Jacobsen

Dana will give a brief introduction to primes, primality testing, and sieves, then show examples in Perl.  Dana is the author of the [https://metacpan.org/module/Math::Prime::Util Math::Prime::Util] module on [http://www.cpan.org/ CPAN].  Outline:

* Primes
* Applications
* Primality testing in Perl
* Sieves
* 15 sieve implementations in Perl including a new string-based sieve
* 6 CPAN modules
* Performance and memory use
* Prime Counting

Sadly a lot of the [http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Perl web] [http://www.scriptol.com/programming/sieve.php examples] [http://dada.perl.it/shootout/sieve.perl.html of] [http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/col26.html Perl] [http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/ZIGDON/Math-Prime-TiedArray-0.04/lib/Math/Prime/TiedArray.pm sieves] are quite bad, often 3-6x slower than Perl can do.  [https://gist.github.com/4162676 We can do better!]   There are also a number of CPAN modules related to primes, which will briefly be covered.
