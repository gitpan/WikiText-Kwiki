== January Meeting ==
==== January 11th, 6:30pm at Free Geek, 1741 SE 10th Ave   ====

MichaelSchwern would like to give "Design of Everyday Programs" about the valuable programming lessons to be learned from the industrial design book [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385267746/103-8553731-9261423?v=glance&n=283155 Design of Everyday Things].  "Design Patterns" borrowed concepts and vocabulary from architecture, I hope to borrow some from industrial design.  Also, the educational value of video games!

Afterwards, as always, beer at the LuckyLab!
