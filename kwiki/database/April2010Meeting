=== The Amazing Incredible Miracle of [http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Class DBIx::Class] ===

speaker: RobertBuels

Rob will give an introduction to and overview of [http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Class DBIx::Class].  It's an object-relational mapping framework, much better than the old Class::DBI, and it will make your life easier if you are currently writing a lot of SQL in your Perl.
