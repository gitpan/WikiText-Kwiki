=== Bucardo ===

Speaker: [http://www.chesnok.com/daily/ Selena Deckelmann]

Bucardo is a mature replication system written in Perl for PostgreSQL
that supports asynchronous replication for both master-slave and
multi-master systems. Originally designed for slow and unreliable
networks, it has remarkable recovery ability, an easy to use
command-line interface and development is active! Uses for Bucardo
include: a slave read-only database, multi-master replication, data
warehousing and just having fun moving your data around! Will include
overview replication for PostgreSQL in general, a tour of features,
and a basic configuration walk through.
