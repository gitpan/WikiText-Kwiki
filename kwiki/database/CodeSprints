== PDX.pm Code Sprints ==

PDX.pm hosts weekly code sprints to work on Perl 5/Perl 6/Parrot, write docs, work on your own projects, whatever.  They're on Thursdays, 6:30pm or so, at the SE [Lucky Lab http://www.luckylab.com].  Check [Calagator http://calagator.org/events/search?query=hackathon] for the latest announcement.
