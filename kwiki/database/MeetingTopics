  lightning talks:  what I'm doing this week
    I have questions about this...

  o introductory talks

    o best practices

    o how to write subroutines

    o perl version-number issues ?

    o variable naming / scoping

    o ten worst ideas

    o choosing cpan modules
      or finding it elsewhere
      (and identifying good code)

    o perl in sysadmin automation

    o perl in network admin automation
     (may be a cool combo topic with the sysadmin automation!)   

* Meeting topics vs. location

  o reminder e-mail
    o bot / extra list
  o update wiki with next meeting topic
    o better blurbs about why you should come to the meeting
    o labeled BEGINNER/MID-LEVEL/ADVANCED
  o make front page be the wiki
  o topic 1 month in advance

  o location is not an issue
    o maybe starting at 7:00
    o guaranteed finished by 8/8:15 might work
