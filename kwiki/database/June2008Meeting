Topic: Demystifying !DBIx::Class

!ORMs aren't mystic, and neither is !DBIx::Class. Come to this talk to 
learn how to do the basics with !DBIx::Class and see some sufficiently 
advanced technology that is distinguishable from magic.

In this brief talk, attendees will learn how to create a schema and 
manage the data in their database all without touching a line of SQL. 
Using only what is available on CPAN, build a database of brewers and 
their beers complete with a review system.

Demystifying DBIC
* What's an ORM?
* Why are !ORMs Scary?
* What makes DBIC Different
** Objects
** Relations
** Management
*** In Perl without SQL
** Deployment
* A Use Case:
** Beer!
** Sit back down. We're only talking about beer in the abstract.
** Beers are made by brewers and distributed by distributors.  (Lots of good relations here.)
** Creating the database
** Writing scripts
