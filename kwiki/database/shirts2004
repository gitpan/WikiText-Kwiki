The shirts will cost $10 (+$2 for XXL and up), are 100% cotton, and will come with a free button that says, "#!/usr/local/pdx", so people know we're locals at oscon.  Sign up here with your name and the number of shirts you want, with sizes, so we know how many to get.

It will have a larger version of last year's logo, with a phrase like "#!/usr/bin/pdx" on the back.

If you want a button, but not a shirt, it will be $1.  Sign up anyway and say you just want a button.
