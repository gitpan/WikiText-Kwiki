== April Meeting ==

When: April 14th, 2004 6:30pm

Where: Free Geek, 1741 SE 10th Ave

What: [chromatic], talking about game development with Parrot:

* Parrot, the VM for Perl 6, is an object oriented assembly language with an exceedingly rich vocabulary of primitives -- if "primitives" is the right word.  What happens when you link it to a nice multimedia library such as SDL?  How much code does it take to do something interesting?

* This talk covers Parrot, object-oriented Parrot programming, Parrot's native call interface, the Simple !DirectMedia Library, and, finally, everything in SDL Parrot that works by the day of the talk.

* *Missed the talk?* The slides are online: http://wgz.org/chromatic/talks/parrot_sdl/index.html
* chromatic has a page about Parrot SDL: http://wgz.org/chromatic/parrot/sdl/
* Dan Sugalski's new article on Building a Parrot Compiler: http://admin.oreillynet.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/04/15/parrot_compiler_construction.html

AND: JoeOppegaard, talking about Curses::UI

* Curses::UI is a curses based OO user interface framework, giving many convenient widgets you would expect. This talk will cover using Curses::UI specifically drawn on the experience of writing sysv-rc-conf  (http://sysv-rc-conf.sf.net)
