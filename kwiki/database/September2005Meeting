chromatic, Seven Sins of OO Perl

Perl's OO model is flexible and minimal so that capable programmers can
change it to make their problems. Unfortunately, sometimes it's a little
too flexible and minimal. This talk shows why seven too-common practices
are dangerous (or at least wrong) and what to do instead.

In lieu of the slides, here are the seven sins:

0 Don't call methods as functions (especially methods in UNIVERSAL)
0 Don't use AUTOLOAD() to generate methods unless you know the four things you need to do to make it work reliably
0 Don't use indirect object method calls, even for constructors
0 Access instance data directly only from accessor methods
0 Don't forbid inheritance from your classes
0 Use Test::Class to make everyone's life easier
0 Don't use inheritance when aggregation, delegation, roles, or mixins would do

Afterwards, as always, beer at the LuckyLab!
