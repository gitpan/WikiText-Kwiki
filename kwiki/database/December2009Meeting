You have an idea for some program that you've always said you would write when you got a round tuit.  !FreeTUIT gives you that first tuit for free.  Now you can write a simple cross-platform desktop application without writing any code.  Just declare the widget layout and put a shebang line on it and you have an executable application.  From there, it's a simple matter of programming to respond to input events.

!FreeTUIT is a syntax and Perl runtime for concisely declaring the layout and configuration of GUI widgets (such as forms, toolbars, buttons, and dialogs).  The freetuit interpreter drives a unified object layer which is accessible from event callbacks.  The system is currently built on top of the wxWidgets toolkit, and is currently in transition to the Qt widget set.
