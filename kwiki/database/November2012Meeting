= CI Throwdown

  Thu. November 8th, 6:53pm at at FreeGeek â€“ 1731 SE 10th Ave.

speaker: Jonathan "Duke" Leto

So, there's this dude named Travis who lives in a cloud and has nothing better to do on a Thursday night than download your latest commit, run your tests, and ridicule you on the twitternets when you broke the build... or something like that. But even if you don't need your pocket to jiggle on the way to fried pies, you should have some sort of automated continuous integration setup testing your code to keep you and your commits working smoothly. Jonathan will talk about Travis CI, demonstrate setting-up Travis for a public github project, and cover some of Jitterbug. 

As usual, the meeting will be followed by social hour at the Lucky Lab Brew Pub.
