= Code cleanup and refactoring without the "scary".

speaker: Chad 'Exodist' Granum

Refactoring is something many developers approach with a great deal of fear. Sometimes you may need to refactor code that you do not understand. Sometimes there are no unit tests. Sometimes things can be scary.

I will be showing techniques for cleaning/refactoring code that will help avoid errors, and make things less scary. Ideally people will bring small/medium code samples or modules as examples. If nobody brings anything we may pull something off of cpan.
