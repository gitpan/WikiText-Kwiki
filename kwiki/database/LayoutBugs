This site is powered by [Kwiki http://www.kwiki.org].  RandallHansen  is tweaking it with the following goals:
0 Valid XHTML and CSS,
0 Accessible to people with disabilities and non-GUI and non-!JavaScript browsers,
0 Separation of content and presentation using CSS for layout.

It's a work in progress, and there are bugs.  This is the perfect place to list them.

=== Visual bugs (damn, that's ugly) ===
* Horizontal rule on preview page is offset 100px right.

=== Markup bugs (hmmm ... that doesn't validate) ===
* These bugs are fixed but the code isn't live yet:
** Images don't have [=alt] attribute
** Some tags aren't closed ([=li, hr, img])

=== Accessibility bugs (is it usable with a screen reader?) ===
* History drop-down should have "Go" button (or something).
