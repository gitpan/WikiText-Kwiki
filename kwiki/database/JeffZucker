Describe the new page here.  ... It's a page like any other page, which is to say, since this is the web, it isn't a page at all. Me? I'm a longtime Portland resident (off and on since 1967) involved in perl DBI and in use of software in support of non-profits and social justice issues.  See my [home-non-page http://www.vpservices.com/jeff/] for details.
