= Programming in the Future + Intro to Dist::Zilla

speakers:  Eric Wilhelm + Jonathan "Duke" Leto

(Rumored cameo / lightning talk by Florian "rafl" Ragwitz.)

Programming in the Future - a preview of the upcoming OSCON presentation covering the last and next 25 years of programming technology using Perl as our time machine.  We'll look at the evolution of tools, syntax, modules, and standard practices, the gooey innards, and some "hot new things" which are still being discovered again.

Introduction to Dist::Zilla for Newbies - eliminates your excuses for not learning more about Dist::Zilla and using it on a regular basis.  By the end of this talk, you will know how and why to use dzil as your favorite Perl package developer tool, and you might even need to publish more code on the CPAN just to have an excuse to use it more.
