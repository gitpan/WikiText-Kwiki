Employed for a year developing perl web/database marketing solutions, in the very early days of .Com systems for NCD.COM, I write code relying heavily on fully tested subroutines, perl_modules, and code monkey tools, since my standards are very high.  A non-linear thinker, my non-creative "cut splice and debug" skills are exceptional.  Dashing together solutions for systems administration, I usually just grab source, tinker together whatever works until a SourceForge tools springs up in it's place.
