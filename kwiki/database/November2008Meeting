Topic:  A Sitter for Cisco Syslogs

Syslog is a handy troubleshooting tool, but only if you actually read
what's logged.  I wrote a Cisco syslog parser & reporter as part of
our network fault-management system. We'll go over:

* network management basics
* why we needed this specific tool
* why I created my own tool from scratch instead of using an off-the-shelf solution
* how I did it & what the results were, and
* what I'm going to do next.

You don't need to be a Cisco engineer or even know much Perl to get
something out of this talk.
