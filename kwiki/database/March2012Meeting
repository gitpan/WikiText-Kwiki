= !VoteFair ranking: Math-based voting power for the 99%

Presenter: Richard Fobes

The new CPAN module named Voting::!VoteFairRanking yields higher levels of voting fairness.  You do voting when you click on Google results, and you use voting results when you view the star rating of an Amazon product.

Now learn how voting really works, how it is usually miscalculated -- intentionally in the case of elections -- and how it can be done to fully extract the wisdom in a group.  Learn the math behind the puppet strings that connect politicians (of both parties) to the biggest campaign contributors.  (Partial spoiler: The biggest unfairness is hidden in primary elections.)  Also learn the math that eventually will cut those puppet strings.  Along the way you will learn that there are different kinds of popularity.
