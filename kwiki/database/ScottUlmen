I read 'Learning Perl' almost 6months ago and really enjoyed it.  I am very interested in learning to program, but since it is only for personal growth right now, it is difficult to stay motivated to continue learning.  I have been trying to get back into it and hope that attending some of the Perl Mongers meetings will keep me interested.

I would be more than interested in getting together with someone as a 'study partner' either via email or in person to help each other learn.  Guess I should add a contact!

Additionally, I am visiting perlmonks.org (I'm zerogeek) on a regular basis trying to sponge up as much knowledge as possible.
