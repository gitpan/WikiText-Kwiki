= Modern Web Frameworks Panel

This informal panel / round-table discussion will review and demonstrate what has changed over the last few years since Plack has become the leading deployment/glue technology for Perl web applications.

While Plack/PSGI is a vastly more flexible, maintainable, deployable, and scalable model than CGI, in many ways it is a back-to-basics simplification of the ways in which code and servers interact.  It has also led to new web frameworks which allow you to forget about all of those fundamental details.  We'll try to look at the overall picture, plus specific examples and discuss use cases and migration experiences.

Panel members:

  Ben:  Dancer demo
  Joshua: a second person to answer Dancer questions
  Clay: CGI to Plack conversion
  Eric: server options for testing and deployment
