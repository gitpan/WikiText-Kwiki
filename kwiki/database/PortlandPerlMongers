= Monthly Meeting

PDX.pm meetings are on the second Thursday of each month at 6:53pm, typically at [http://freegeek.org/ Free Geek].  Meetings are free-of-charge for all PortlandPerlMongerMembers.  The cost for non-members is $2,000,000,000.00 per person.

Membership is free and open to everyone on a self-serve basis.  Just join the MailingList or add yourself to the members page, come to meetings, and have fun.

See the FutureMeetings page for upcoming meetings.
