= CPAN and Core Q&A =

speaker: anyone and everyone

Possible topics:

* configuring your CPAN/CPANPLUS client
* what makes a module
* what happens when you install a module (where does stuff go?)
* what happens when you load a module
* how to make a distribution
* how distributions get on the CPAN (PAUSE)
* how distributions get found by the CPAN client
* what a distribution contains, metadata

HDP will talk a bit about CPAN infrastructure.  Jonathan and other attendees from last week's code sprint will share some of what they learned about hacking the perl 5 core.

Bring your own questions (and maybe some answers.)
