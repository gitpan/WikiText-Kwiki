=== Getting (hopefully just your feet) Wet with Catalyst ===

Speaker: Jay Shirley

Jay is leading a large refactoring effort at [http://www.picturetrail.com/ a social networking company] where he is currently handling over a million requests per day from a [Catalyst http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst/] app which also co-exists with legacy code.

The talk includes a quick overview, followed by "Hello World/Catalyst Concepts" in an interactive format, and then a demonstration of a simple real world application (Paste system.)
