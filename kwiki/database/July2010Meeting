== Rakudo Feet Wettening

speaker: you and us

The Rakudo * release of Perl 6 on Parrot is almost here. Whether you want to get your own feet wet, or help wetten someone else's feet, join us to write some Perl 6 code and share some learning.

We'll begin with introductions, cover some basics, and then work in small groups or pairs for about an hour, followed by a recap, then (of course) social hour at the LuckyLab.

If you can bring a laptop, download and install rakudo ahead of time:

  $ git clone git://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.git
  $ cd rakudo
  $ perl Configure.pl --gen-parrot
  $ make
  $ make install
  $ PATH=$PWD/parrot_install/bin/:$PATH
  $ perl6 -e 'say "Hello World"'
