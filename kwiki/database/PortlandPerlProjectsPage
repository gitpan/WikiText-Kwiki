== Portland Perl Projects ==
This page comes from the "Help Wanted" idea that
Ovid inspired one late night in September at the LuckyLab.

Some people have tuits or want to learn, but don't know where to start.
Some people have great ideas but little/no time.
Some people don't have ideas or time but like to kibitz.

Let's get together, collaborate, test, code, and release Portland code upon an unsuspecting world!

=== Project Ideas: ===
* [ProjectEulerChallenge]
* [gabrielle]: uhhh update our website
* JonathanLeto: [CodeSprints] to put PDX.pm ON THE MAP.
