Topic:   IMAP: everything you ever wanted to do with mail except send it

In the open standards world, centralized remote mail stores are usually
reached through the magic of IMAP, the Internet Mail Access Protocol.
The convenience of using common tools like grep and procmail, however,
is lost when relocating one's mail from a local, Berkeley-style mailbox
to an IMAP server. With a little scripting (and the right IMAP server),
these conveniences can be regained.

Wil will present an overview of IMAP covering the following topics:

* Anatomy of an IMAP server
* On the Wire: The protocol itself
* Sieve, a special-purpose scripting language for mail filtering
* Scripting on-line mail processing with Perl
