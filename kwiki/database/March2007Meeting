== A Small Smalltalk Talk ==

Rik Smoody of [http://smoo.com smOOdynamics] presented various aspects of Smalltalk, including:

* Test-Driven Development the Squeak way
* Seaside (web framework from which Jifty has stolen many ideas)
* It's Objects all the way down

There is a podcast, but it is currently suffering from having been recorded too close to the projector fan...  Perhaps it will appear on the [http://pdxpm.podasp.com podcast page].
