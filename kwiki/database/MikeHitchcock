Hi, my name is Mike Hitchcock. I live in NE Portland with
my wife, four sons (3, 6, 9, and 12 years old), and Twinkles
the wondercat.

I work downtown in the Fox Tower. I am VP of Systems Engineering
for CollegeNET, Inc. We do online admissions apps for about 650
colleges and universities, and membership and donation forms for
nonprofits. Last year we processed about 950,000 college applications.
I started working on the forms engine in 1996. It is written in Perl.

This year's OSCON will be my seventh Perl Conference (I missed the very
first one, and the second Monterrey conference). This conference
is what puts the wind in my sails to make it through another year!
